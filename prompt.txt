List all the meetings in february, with each meeting following this specific format.

<Month> <day> <topic>
Opening [<name>, <name>, <name>]: (15)
Skill [<name>, <name>]: (20)
Game [<name>, <name>]: (20)
Intrapatrol [<name>, <name>]: (20)
Closing [<name>, <name>, <name>]: (15)

Only fill in the parts that are in angled brackets <>, leave everything else in the template exactly as it is. No extra characters like asterisks. For <name>, use the letters assigned and convert them to names based on this key:
A = Daiwik
B = Anish
C = Rohan
D = Aneesh
E = AT
F = Tavish
G = Tejas
For example, if it assigns "CD", you should replace the corresponding <name>, <name> with Rohan, Aneesh.
Write out the month fully.
Replace <topic> only if the meeting lists a topic, and put square brackets [] around it. Otherwise, replace it with just [].
